How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Choosing when to create a commit allows you to determine whether the changes made needs to be commited. 
Commiting changes like in google docs will not allow the programmer to look back at useful commits that actually effected the program.
